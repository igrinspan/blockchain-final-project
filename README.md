# blockchain-final-project

This project is designed to implement a decentralized management platform for property owner associations, commonly known as "consorcios". These associations typically manage shared responsibilities within apartment buildings, such as renovations, purchases, and cleaning services.

It was developed as part of a university course titled **"Fundamentos y Aplicaciones de Blockchains"**, to showcase the practical applications of Ethereum smart contracts in real-world scenarios.

The contract provides functionality for:

1. **Owner Management**: Tracks and manages the list of property owners (landlords) involved in the association.
2. **Proposals and Voting**: Facilitates the submission of proposals related to building management and allows landlords to vote on these proposals.
3. **Expense Tracking**: Manages expenses for the upcoming month and ensures collective decisions are made transparently and fairly.

The contract aims to enhance transparency and efficiency in decision-making processes by leveraging blockchain's immutability and smart contract automation.

- **Tools used for Unit and Property Testing**:
  - **Chai** for unit tests.
  - **Hardhat** for deploying and simulating smart contract interactions.
  - **Echidna** for property-based fuzz testing to ensure the robustness of the system under various conditions.

This system demonstrates the potential of Ethereum smart contracts to improve real-world processes in decentralized environments while integrating theoretical and practical knowledge acquired during the course.
